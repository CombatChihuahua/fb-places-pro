=============

Plug-in to enhance the productivity of the fb places editor https://www.facebook.com/editor

This plug in puts the normal fb editor map inside a box to the right of the main editor.
It then adds controls to lookup the current editing node in bing, with or without
including the city. A more prominent "report" button is also added.
