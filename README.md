=============

This repo has been permanently moved to: https://github.com/fbwiki/graph-editor-chrome-extension

---

fb-places-pro is a chrome extension designed to enhance the productivity of the
fb places editor https://www.facebook.com/editor

This extension puts the normal fb editor map inside a box to the right of the main editor.
It then adds several useful controls to the editor.

The current production version of this extension is installable from
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fb-places-pro/imnppmbmlacllpppkbcnjfnadjikmpgi?hl=en-US

I've had requests for a Firefox version. If anyone would like to work on that please fork
the new repo at https://github.com/fbwiki/graph-editor-chrome-extension rather
than this one.
